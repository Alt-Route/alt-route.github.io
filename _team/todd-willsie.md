img_alt: Todd is seen here shredding on a longboard. It's because he's a fat man and
  can't keep his balance on a regular skateboard. Don't worry Todd wrote this description
  so he's not offended by what the Screen Reader has said about him.

At 36, Todd helps the team by taking photos, slow motion videos and volunteering his time building the Alt Route website or helping out with events. He is also the President of the Calgary Extra Life Guild, a cyber security professional, and a crazy talented designer. When he isn't being creative you can catch him ripping along on his longboard.
