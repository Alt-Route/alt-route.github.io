img_alt: Todd is seen here shredding on a longboard. It's because he's a fat man and can't keep his balance on a regular skateboard. Don't worry Todd wrote this description so he's not offended by what the Screen Reader has said about him.

At 36, Todd is a vision normie (boooo) but he helps the team by taking photos, slow motion videos and volunteering his time building the Alt Route website or helping out with events (yayyy!). He is also the President of the Calgary Extra Life Guild, a cyber security pro, and a crazy talented creative.
