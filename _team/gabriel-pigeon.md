Gabriel, is a 13 year old, living with Macular hypoplasia, strabismus and nystagmus - which makes him legally blind. Gabriel has no depth perception or peripheral vision. He wants to skateboard because the first time he saw someone skateboarding he wanted to try. Unfortunately his visual impairment made it very difficult. "Now that there has been more attention brought to accessible skateboarding this gives me a chance to learn like I've wanted to".  

Some of the things Gabriel likes to do in his spare time is Skateboarding, skiing and playing video games.
