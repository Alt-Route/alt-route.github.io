At 13, Gabriel is living with Macular hypoplasia, strabismus and nystagmus - which makes him legally blind. He skateboards because "the first time I saw someone skateboarding I wanted to try." Now that more attention is on accessible skateboarding, this gives him a chance to learn like he always wanted. Outside of school Gabriel is skateboarding, skiing and playing video games.
