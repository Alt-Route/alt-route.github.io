Alt Route Founder, Curtis Ruttle, wrote an article for CNIB explaining his work on the Alt Route project. We'd say more, but the article speaks for itself. Way to go Curtis!

Also big shout out and thanks to CNIB for all of their amazing support and for posting the article Curtis wrote on their social media!
