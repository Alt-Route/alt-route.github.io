We are excited to have been highlighted by the Calgary Herald. Journalist Jason Herring and the Calgaru Herald film crew took the time to chill with the Alt Route project team and ask us a bunch of questions. Questions we gave a bunch of answers to!

Thank you Jason Herring and the Calgary Herald for checking out our project.
