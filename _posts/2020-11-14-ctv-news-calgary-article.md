We are pumped to have been highlighted by CTV News Calgary. Journalist Timm Bruch and the CTV News camera crew took the time to hang out with the Alt Route project team and film some of the amazing participants that were skating at The Compound skate park. They asked a lot of questions and we gave a lot of answers!

Thank you Timm Bruch and CTV New Calgary for checking out our project.
