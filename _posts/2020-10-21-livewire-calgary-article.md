We are proud to have been highlighted by Livewire Calgary. Journalist Omar Sherif took the time to hang out with the Alt Route project team and highlight one of our skater's, Cassandra, as she accomplished one of her biggest skateboarding goals. That goal? Dropping in on the big ramp at The Compound! She not only crushed her goal, but she crushed it while celebrating her 13th birthday, what a birthday gift!

Thank you Omar Sherif and the Livewire team for checking out our project.
